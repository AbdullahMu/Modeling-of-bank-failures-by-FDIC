# Modeling-of-bank-failures-by-FDIC
FDIC dataset used to predict bank defaults. You will use Logistic Regression from scikit-learn model, construct your own Logistic Regression model using Tensorflow, and, finally build and train Neural Network for bank failure prediction

**Key Concepts:**
* Develop a user case of application of Supervised Learning algorithms to finance.
* Discuss usages of ML for trading, asset management, banking risk management.
* Apply both Linear and Non-Linear, Neural Network Regression to solve the problem of prediction of Earnings Per Share.
* Use fluently TensorFlow and other packages such as Scikit-Learn and Statsmodels.
